# Homework-1 

# Description  

# In this proyect  I searched and finded  HTML tags that do not give a good semantics to our page as well to our CSS file, I added comments and also I corrected some little things.

# I really enjoyed working on this proyect and learned the importance to have good semantics in our proyects so in the in the long time will be easier to work in the code.


# Solved problems

 * In this proyect we structure correctly the web page with the right semantic HTML tags, so we can have a better SEO. We putted the header, nav, main, section, aside and footer tags correctly, as well, we added some alt and title attributes for img tags.

 * We fix the search-engine-optimization link in our navigation menu. We added and "id" selector, so every time you clic on it, it will send you to the search-engine-optimization SECTION with any problem.

 * We commented, consolidated and organized CSS properties and selectors in order to have a correct semantic structure.

 * We corrected the title for our page.

 * We also founded some font-familiy error's in our fonts so we corrected it.
